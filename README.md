# Project ideas for Build Week 3

For your iOS Build Sprint, you will be choosing an idea prompt from the list below and building an iOS app from scratch. To succeed with this project, you will be applying knowledge you've learned throughout the first unit of the iOS curriculum to this project.

You should treat this like a real-world job assignment with your instructor as the client. Like in the real world, you may not be given all the information you need to complete the assignment up front. It is your responsibility to understand the requirements and ask questions if anything is unclear before jumping into the code.

## App Ideas

### Binge Watching Calculator
#### Description
- Figure out how many episodes of a show you need to watch in order to catch up before a new season starts
- Track multiple shows, which episode you've watched up to, and be able to sort/filter by show or present in order of which shows have the highest priority to catch up.

### Medication Tracking
#### Description
- Track medications and when they should be taken or administered.

### Home Mortgage Calculator
#### Description
- Enter basic information about a house purchase and loan info to create a breakdown of the loan for its entire life (monthly payments of principal + interest). Graphs could be shown to visualize the loan details. Perhaps even allow for different loan specs to be compared on a given house purchase to see how they compare.

### Photo De-Duping
#### Description
- Using the Hamming Distance to find the level of similarity between two images, search through a collection of images and find which ones are duplicates.

### Group Lunch Coordinator
#### Description
- Create groups of users and suggest locations to meet for lunch. Allow group members to vote on locations and then provide notifications for users to know when to leave for lunch.

### Countdown Tracker
#### Description
- Create a record of some event happening in the future and provide an interface to show how many days, hours, minutes, seconds are left. Let the user add tags or categories to each event. Provide settings to allow the user to decide how granular the countdowns should be. Allow the user to sort/filter the events by tags/categories or show in order of when they will come due.

### Notes Transcriber
#### Description

Using iOS 13â€™s new speech-to-text API, provide either a live audio recording, or a pre-recorded audio file and allow the app to create a transcription as text that can be exported.

#### Technologies

* Speech-to-text API
* Share sheet to export text

## Deliverables

Each student or student pair is responsible for building an app that fulfills the requirements of one of the ideas above in the time allotted. The app will be delivered as a completed Xcode project in a GitHub repo for review by the TLs and the instructor. The student or student pair will also produce a short presentation of their app including a demo to be shared with the cohort on the last day of the Build Sprint.
